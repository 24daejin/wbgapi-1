# provides alternate matching strings for corresponding ISO3 codes, in addition
# to strings provided by the API itself. Each string is treated as a case-insensitive regex
# pattern restricted to word boundaries. In addition, sugar is applied so that
# 'and' and '&' are equivalent as are 'st' and 'saint'
#
# strings beginning with ':' are treated as strings not patterns, and must match the 
# target text exactly (still case-insensitive)
#
# note that in the target string apostrophes are removed and remaining non-alpha characters
# replaced with spaces
