# ancillary and deprecated code. Not currently included in the implementation

# Here's an object-oriented approach we may use someday, but I'm not sure it's especially practical
# to implement from region, lendingtype or incomelevel. Update list() and get() to yield or return
# Region(row) instead of row

class Region(dict):
    @property
    def members(self):
        return members(self['code'])

Other potentially useful, not-well-docuented API parameters:

NB: I don't think any of these have default or implicit values

downloadformat=csv|xml|excel - download a complete data file for a topic, indicator or country. Delivered as a ZIP file with
                                     separate files for metadata

filetype=data                - with downloadformat, download the original file format instead of ZIP with no metadata

HREQ=(y|n)                   - with downloadformat, omit the metadata headers so the first row is the column names (csv and excel only)

databid:                     - with /v2/en/sources, this will include the internal database ID you need for Databank links
